# Week-1-HW (My Edit)

IN HTML
-Edited many of the divs to correspond to <header> <main> <section> <aside> <footer> <nav>

-I included some <meta> tags within the header to optimize keywords and title to get more clicks/visits based on what people will search for

-I added a missing ID to the first <section> so that the Nav-Bar will jump to a certain section of the page when clicked

-I added alt="" and title="" to the images for screen reader accessibility and cursor hover messages

-READ THE README HW DESCRIPTION AND FINALIZE THE REST OF THIS README IN CORRESPONDENCE TO WHAT IS NEEDED

-Defined a concise and descriptive title

IN CSS
-lots of redundant code with different classes so I began creating one class to define certain parts that had the same css .benefit-lead-brand-cost and .sections-three
