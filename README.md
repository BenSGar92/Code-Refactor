# Week-1-HW

IN HTML
-I began by google-fu-ing SEO, quickly I edited many of the divs to correspond to <header> <main> <section> <aside> <footer>

-I included some <meta> tags within the header to optimize keywords and title to get more clicks/visits based on what people will search for

-I added a missing ID to the first <section> so that the Nav-Bar will jump to a certain section of the page when clicked

-

IN CSS
-lots of redundant code with different classes so I began creating one class to define certain parts that had the same css
